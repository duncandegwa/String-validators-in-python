# String-validators-in-python
Often times, we work with strings and want to quickly check if they are of a particular type or contain specific data. While we can do the same by either storing the characters of the string in a data structure or explicitly writing down statements to verify, string validators in Python can simplify our task. This can be useful when validating a password string or any other user input. String validators are essentially functions that allow us to check if a string meets certain criteria.
This post is an introduction to string validators and assumes no prior knowledge of them
