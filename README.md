#### Proposed title of article
An Introduction To Figma Interactive Components

#### Proposed article introduction
Often times, we work with strings and want to quickly check if they are of a particular type or contain specific data. While we can do the same by either storing the characters of the string in a data structure or explicitly writing down statements to verify, string validators in Python can simplify our task. This can be useful when validating a password string or any other user input. String validators are essentially functions that allow us to check if a string meets certain criteria. 

#### Key takeaways
- Checking if a Given String Is Alphanumeric 
- Checking if a Given String Is Alphabetic 
- Checking if a Given String Is All Numbers
-  Checking if a Given String Is Lowercase 
- Checking if a Given String Is Uppercase 
- Checking if a Given String Is Blank 
- Checking if a Given String Is Title Cased


#### Article quality
This article is an introduction to string validators and assumes no prior knowledge of them. We will build a simple application that will accept user input eg login credentials then we validate the entered user input.
